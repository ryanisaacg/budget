It is assumed that the income to the system is in relatively fixed, two week intervals OR there is no money in the system.

Money is divied into accounts (organized as a tree), which are the main entity in the budget system. Accounts may have sub-accounts OR a balance: that is, only leaf nodes may have a balance. The balance of a non-leaf node is the sum of the balances of its children.

Every branch account has an "inflow," or the property that defines how much income it takes from the parent node. Inflows are either flat amounts, or free-remainings (where the amount deposited into the account is (my fr) / (total fr) * remaining_balance)

Inflows may have, but do not need, a maximum value. If an account is at or above its maximum value it has an effective inflow of 0.

Withdrawals have an amount and an account. You can withdraw an account to below 0, as this budgeting app isn't meant to simulate a bank, just help you divide your money.
